## Proud Repositories

### [üñãÔ∏è](# "Innovation") [Haxicord](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/Haxicord) ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-248-brightgreen?style=plastic) ![stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/raidandfade/haxicord?style=plastic) 

The first fully featured [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) programming language Discord Library. Allowing for easy and managed access to Discord's API through convenient library functions.

### [‚öôÔ∏è](# "Reverse Engineering") [PyCASC](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/PyCASC), [PyWDBX](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/PyWDBX), [WoWFileFormat](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/WoWFileFormat)

Pure python implementations of Blizzard's proprietary [CASC](https://wowdev.wiki/CASC) file-container format, and their proprietary [WDB](https://wowdev.wiki/DB2) database format. As well as some automation tools using Machine Learning Random-Forest Classification networks in order to automatically discover new/unknown files within these formats, as Blizzard does not release public information about any of their files.

### [‚öôÔ∏è](# "Reverse Engineering") [JS-MIPS](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/MIPS)

A purely javascript implementation of the [MIPS Achitecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture) , complete with a valid MIPS compiler that produces real binaries, and an in-browser MIPS emulator that can run binaries in real time with support for Syscalls including print and input

### [‚ú®](# "Community")[Hacktoberfest2018](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/HacktoberChallenges2018) ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/raidandfade/HacktoberChallenges2018?style=plastic) and [Hacktoberfest2019](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/OctoberChallenges2019) ![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/raidandfade/OctoberChallenges2019?style=plastic)

Two repositories of collective [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) commits run and managed by me, getting the Github community together to make something cool during DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest event. Personally benefited through massive user interaction (over a thousand combined commits, with multiple unique coding challenges and hundreds of distinct contributors)

### [‚öôÔ∏è](# "Reverse Engineering") [Banshee](https://github.com/RaidAndFade/Banshee)

A C# implementation of [Warcraft 3](https://playwarcraft3.com/)'s LAN server. Created by reverse engineering the game's protocol and creating a server to replicate those responses.

### [‚öôÔ∏è](# "Reverse Engineering") [Terrelay](https://github.com/Terrelay/Terrelay)

A [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) MITM proxy made in python that takes advantage of the game's blind trust between client and server communication in order to add some nifty features and cheats.
